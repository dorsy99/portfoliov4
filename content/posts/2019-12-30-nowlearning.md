## Why do we love virtual badges so much?

Ever since ServiceNow announced the new [Now Profile](https://account.servicenow.com/personal-data/11e9c2e8b/bd7f2d4ad/b40a6cdff/a1f44WP8E/resume.html), [Now Learning](http://nowlearning.servicenow.com/) and [Now Creators](https://www.servicenow.com/now-creators.html) programs I have been meaning to spend some time looking through the offerings and getting a few of the badges and micro-certs (for free!).

The week post-Christmas lined up pretty well with a public holiday on the Wednesday and most of my colleagues on leave, so I booked the rest of the week Work From Home and queued up a bunch of learning plans. I'll be honest, I have been looking at all the badges and certifications and people posting on LinkedIn about getting them and been a little jealous. 

My first point of call was the CMDB Fundamentals course. It consists of two Micro-Certifications and a *whole bunch* of badges. I have had a fair bit of experience with CMDB since setting up Discovery, attending a few in-person workshops and learning the CMDB Health side of things, so I knew it would be something I could smash out pretty quick. Here's my thoughts so far:
- The Now Learning site is great, the courses are well presented and it actually teaches you a lot
- It's easy to get started and keep going
- The Simulators are *really* good. Like... You click a button, wait a few seconds, and **bam** you have a new instance to use and validate your knowledge. No logins, no waiting to wake a developer instance, really really cool.
- The questions for the Simulators are very well written, and don't spoon-feed you too much. The validation shows you what your outcome should be, and you can go from there
- I do love badges

Here's how I did after day 1:

## Next on the agenda

Obviously this is only one day, and it was mostly stuff I've done before. Next up I want to look at Machine Learning, Virtual Agent, Agent Workspace, IntegrationHub and specifically ATF. Testing is one part of the platform I really need to brush up on. 

I've also wanted to do a few more [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH1byb2cbzlFrYndyKic_Lg) around stuff that I find interesting (the new KPI composer for Performance Analytics? So cool!) so maybe you'll see them show up soon. Maybe.
