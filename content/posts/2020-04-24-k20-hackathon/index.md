Time flies when you are working from home in quarantine, amirite? It's now roughly 1 week from the [2020 CreatorCon Virtual Hackathon](https://hacknow.service-now.com/hacknow/?id=creatorcon) where members from the  ServiceNow community will be "Battling it out" for "Fame and Prizes" by creating an app to solve real-world problems on-platform.

Hackathons are something that I have always wanted to do, but never had the opportunity. Being virtual means this year I can really throw myself at the challenge and hopefully have a great outcome. 

I'm joining a team with some friends from Australia:flag_au:  and maybe some of the Developer MVP guys, and am going to try stream as much of the event as I can on [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH1byb2cbzlFrYndyKic_Lg). I will also try blogging a bit either during or after the event, but no promises - I might be way too busy.

There's going to be heaps of stuff going on over the weekend, so make sure to follow the [Dev Program YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdXorgCT87YlFRN9n8oJ7_A), [Developer Blog](https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do) and [#ServiceNowDev on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ServiceNowDev). While you are there check out [K20 Proper](https://knowledge.servicenow.com/) and the [CreatorCon](https://knowledge.servicenow.com/creatorcon.html) for more awesome *#Content*.

If you are joining the hackathon, Let me know in the comments! I'll be sure to follow you during :)

Love, with cut-off gloves and an anarchist pin,
