title: "About Me"

I'm a Husband and Father of two, web technology fan, and work with [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com) for an insurance company in Australia.

I've updated my personal site because I want to share with the world my excitement about the ServiceNow Platform and Community.

Check out my [Blog](/posts/) for my writing (some of which will be personal, some cross-posted from the [ServiceNow Community](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_user_profile&user=86ae4a2ddbd41fc09c9ffb651f961957)) or my Resume (Below) for my experience and achievements.

<!-- But most of all, Thanks! -->
