      - Documentation for VA is a little light on technical details

        - (There's a few APIs which aren't documented at all, and they seem to be quite useful)
      ---
      name: less3
      template: less2

      - There are a whole bunch more System Properties than in the "Properties" module
        - see `com.glide.cs`

      - Don't plan deploys around your renewal dates :(
      ???
      We had the change logged (HA! CHANGE!) and ready to go on a Friday afternoon, but couldn't enable it because our subscriptions hadn't pulled through yet. GARETH!
      Ended up doing it on a Saturday :(

      ### We haven't actually "Sold" budgie.
      ???
      After all the Covid bizniz, he's been left in his cage for now. We were planning a big launch, but it has been rather soft.

      Obviously there's a lot Budgie can do. We have plans to:
      ---
      name: future3
      template: future2
      - Integrate him to Robotic Process Automation to solve repeatable issues for users (Picture a bird yelling at Alexa)
      ---
      name: future4
      template: future3
      - Let him out of his cage via APIs to **Get. Stuff. Done. Cheep.**
      ---
      name: future5
      template: future4
      - Teach him the local vernacular *Maaaate* (Update the NLU to be more in line with our business language)
      ---
      name: future6
      template: future5
      - Give him a phone with Slack so he can let people know when jobs are assigned to them or help people directly in-app.
      ---
      name: future7
      template: future6
      - Get stickers and (maybe) plushies made! (Once we start marketing him a bit more)
      ---
      name: future8
      template: future7
      - Find more gifs, of course ;)
